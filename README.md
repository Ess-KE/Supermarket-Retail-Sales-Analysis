# Supermarket-Retail-Sales-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes supermarket transactional data to uncover key drivers of revenue, profitability, and customer behavior across branches, product lines, and customer segments.
Using Microsoft Excel, I built a multi-sheet executive dashboard that translates raw sales data into actionable business insights for retail decision-makers.
The focus of this project was not just visualization, but business storytelling and operational recommendations.

## Business Problem
Retail managers need to understand:
Which branch performs best — and why?
Are sales driven by transaction volume or basket value?
Do loyalty members generate meaningful revenue uplift?
When do customers spend the most?
Which product lines drive the most profit?
How do gender, payment method, and time-of-day influence sales?
This analysis answers these questions using structured Excel modeling and dashboard reporting.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 3 months of supermarket transaction data, including:
Branch
Product line
Customer type (Member / Normal)
Gender
Payment method
Time of day
Quantity purchased
Unit price
Total sales
Gross income

# Supermarket-Retail-Sales-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes supermarket transactional data to uncover key drivers of revenue, profitability, and customer behavior across branches, product lines, and customer segments.
Using Microsoft Excel, I built a multi-sheet executive dashboard that translates raw sales data into actionable business insights for retail decision-makers.
The focus of this project was not just visualization, but business storytelling and operational recommendations.

## Business Problem
Retail managers need to understand:
Which branch performs best — and why?
Are sales driven by transaction volume or basket value?
Do loyalty members generate meaningful revenue uplift?
When do customers spend the most?
Which product lines drive the most profit?
How do gender, payment method, and time-of-day influence sales?
This analysis answers these questions using structured Excel modeling and dashboard reporting.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 3 months of supermarket transaction data, including:
Branch
Product line
Customer type (Member / Normal)
Gender
Payment method
Time of day
Quantity purchased
Unit price
Total sales
Gross income

## Tools & Techniques Used
Microsoft Excel
Pivot Tables
Calculated Fields
KPI Cards
SUMIFS / COUNTIFS
Pareto Analysis
Normalized Index Modeling
Branch performance comparison
Customer segmentation analysis
Revenue driver decomposition (Price vs Quantity)
Basket value analysis
Time-based performance breakdown

## Key Insights
🏪# Branch Performance:
Giza leads in total sales and gross income.
Higher profitability is driven by larger basket values rather than transaction count.
Alex underperforms on value metrics, suggesting a more price-sensitive market.

👥# Customer Insights:
Loyalty members spend 7–15% more per visit than normal customers.
The revenue uplift is strongest on weekends.
Female customers generate more revenue through both higher visit frequency and larger baskets.

🕒# Time-Based Patterns:
Weekdays generate higher total revenue due to more frequent visits.
Weekends show higher average sale per invoice (larger baskets).
Evening sales are volume-driven (high traffic, normal basket size).

📦# Product Profitability:
Profit contribution is evenly distributed across product lines.
The dataset does not follow a classic 80/20 Pareto pattern.
Growth requires broad-based optimization rather than focusing on one dominant category.

💳# Payment Behavior:
E-wallet dominates in transaction count.
Cash generates the highest total sales and slightly higher basket value.
